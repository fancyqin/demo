				Raised On Rock

				Music:Mikael Nord Andersson, Martin Hansen
				Lyrics:Martin Hansen, Klaus Meine


				I was born in a hurricane
				Nothing to lose and everything to gain
				Ran before I walked
				Reaching for the top
				Out of control just like a runaway train

				I never walked on the narrow path
				I always wanted what I didn’t have
				All was not enough
				Riding lady luck
				Driving in the fast lane and just stepped on the gas

				Cause I was raised on rock
				My dad was howling but my heart was a rolling stone
				Yeah I was raised on rock
				My mama said I had a devil to scratch my soul
				And I was raised on rock

				Raised on rock

				Shoot me up baby make me high
				And hit the jackpot in the heat of the night
				Wanna kiss your lips
				Wanna move your hips
				See my desire in your laser-beam eyes

				You shake me up got me spinning ‘round
				You know what’s going up must come down
				Tomorrow I’ll be gone
				A million miles from home
				The only road I know leads out of town

				Cause I was raised on rock
				My dad was howling but my heart was a rolling stone
				Yeah I was raised on rock
				My mama said I had a devil to scratch my soul
				And I was raised on rock

				Raised on rock

				Growing up with the guitar men
				Growing up way too fast
				Follow the sound of a rock’n’roll band
				This call will always last

				Cause I was raised on rock
				My dad was howling but my heart was a rolling stone
				Yeah I was raised on rock
				My mama said I had a devil to scratch my soul
				Cause I was raised on rock

				Cause I was raised on rock

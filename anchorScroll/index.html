    <h2>Jon</h2>
    <div class="inner">
        <p>Jon is the <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Bastardy" title="Bastardy">bastard</a> son of Lord <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Eddard_Stark" title="Eddard Stark">Eddard Stark</a> of Winterfell,&nbsp;the head of <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/House_Stark" title="House Stark">House Stark</a> and <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Lord_Paramount_of_the_North" title="Lord Paramount of the North">Lord Paramount of the North</a>. Eddard never told anyone, including Jon, who his mother is - an unusual position for a bastard, as they normally know who their mother is but not their father. When Eddard left for the south to fight in <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Robert%27s_Rebellion" title="Robert's Rebellion">Robert's Rebellion</a>, he left his pregnant new bride Lady <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Catelyn_Stark" title="Catelyn Stark">Catelyn Tully</a> at <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Riverrun" title="Riverrun">Riverrun</a> while he continued on campaign, and she later gave birth to his first lawful son, <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Robb_Stark" title="Robb Stark">Robb Stark</a>. When Eddard returned from the war, however, he brought with him an infant boy, which he said was his bastard son that he fathered during the war. Eddard once told King <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Robert_Baratheon" title="Robert Baratheon">Robert Baratheon</a> that Jon's mother was a serving girl named <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Wylla" title="Wylla">Wylla</a> when asked, but he refused to elaborate any further. Eddard never even told Jon himself whether his mother was alive or dead, though he later promised that when he later returned from serving King Robert in King's Landing, he would tell Jon about her (as by then he would have reached the age of adulthood).<sup id="cite_ref-S1EP02_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-S1EP02-1">[2]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>Acknowledged bastard children of lords are usually sent away to one of their other castles or holdings to be taken care of but not kept in the presence of his lawful family. Very unusually, Eddard announced that he would raise Jon at his home castle <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Winterfell" title="Winterfell">Winterfell</a>, alongside his trueborn children with Catelyn. Robb was always treated as Eddard's heir, but otherwise, Jon wasn't treated much differently than his younger half-brothers <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Bran_Stark" title="Bran Stark">Bran</a> and <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Rickon_Stark" title="Rickon Stark">Rickon</a>. Jon's mere presence at Winterfell was an understandable source of friction between Eddard and his wife Catelyn. Given that Jon was never <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Legitimization" title="Legitimization">legitimized</a>, she was never his "stepmother" in any sense of the term or had any obligations to him whatsoever. Instead, he was a living reminder of the one time that Eddard had dishonored her, though otherwise over the years she loved Eddard very deeply. Catelyn never mistreated Jon but she was cold to him and avoided him whenever possible (not that Jon ever said he expected more from her).<sup id="cite_ref-S1EP02_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-S1EP02-1">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[3]</a></sup> Catelyn would later confess to her daughter-in-law <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Talisa_Stark" title="Talisa Stark">Talisa</a> about how Jon caught the pox when he was a child, and she, out of guilt for previously praying for his death, stayed with him through the night and prayed to the gods to let him live, finally accepting that he was not to blame for Eddard's affair with Wylla, though it was still not enough to make her love Jon, something she would later regret.<sup id="cite_ref-S3EP02_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-S3EP02-3">[4]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>Due to his bastard status, Jon grew up feeling like an outsider at Winterfell. He was generally well-treated, but for example when King Robert and Queen Cersei made an official visit to Winterfell, Jon was not allowed to sit inside at the front table with the king and lords, as this might have offended them.<sup id="cite_ref-S1EP02_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-S1EP02-1">[2]</a></sup> Otherwise, Jon still lived better than many peasants do - he was never hungry and always had a roof over his head living in a castle, and received a young lord's martial training from Winterfell's <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Master-at-Arms" title="Master-at-Arms">Master-at-Arms</a>, Ser <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Rodrik_Cassel" title="Rodrik Cassel">Rodrik Cassel</a>. Of his three half-brothers and two half-sisters, Jon was actually quite close friends with Robb - given that they were roughly the same age, they were companions in training and riding. Otherwise, Jon always had the closest relationship with the younger of his two half-sisters, <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Arya_Stark" title="Arya Stark">Arya</a>, who as an adventurous tomboy prone to un-ladylike pursuits also felt like a social outsider. Jon later had the custom sword <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Needle" title="Needle">Needle</a> forged and gave it to Arya as a going-away present.<sup id="cite_ref-S1EP02_1-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-S1EP02-1">[2]</a></sup> However, Jon's relationship with his other half-sister, Sansa - was apparently unpleasant at times, with Sansa often being unkind to him.

Sansa, who is very taken with the handsome young prince, thinks this is a splendid notion. She longs for the excitement of the capital and begs her parents to agree to the match, until they do so. Eddard takes the Handship and decides to take his daughters with him to the capital.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[4]</a></sup>

She also has an older brother, <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Robb_Stark" title="Robb Stark">Robb</a>, two younger brothers, <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Bran_Stark" title="Bran Stark">Bran</a> and <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Rickon_Stark" title="Rickon Stark">Rickon</a> and a bastard half-brother, <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Jon_Snow" title="Jon Snow">Jon Snow</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Arya_viewers_guide_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Arya_viewers_guide-1">[2]</a></sup>

        <p>Arya rejects the notion that she must become a lady and marry for influence and power, instead she believes she can forge her own destiny. She is fascinated by warfare and training in the use of arms, and is bored by embroidery and other "lady-like" pursuits. She takes after her father and has a quarrelsome relationship with her sister Sansa, due to their contrasting interests and personalities. She is close to her half-brother Jon, who is also something of an outcast.<sup id="cite_ref-Arya_viewers_guide_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Arya_viewers_guide-1">[2]</a></sup>
